One issue with the microwave is that there is no button to open the door, a lot of times there is a button to open the microwave door and so you might be looking for a way to open it if you are unfamiliar but really all you do is pull on the handle. 

The hold 3 sec button is not clear at all with what it does, it is right next to the cancel button so you may think that holding the cancel button for three seconds makes it lock. Still, the lock function itself is unclear with what it locks. 

The microwave does not have any automatic minute functions, you can only type in the numbers and that is the time it goes for. This may be more straightforward but I think that most microwaves give the automatic feature, example: if you press one it will go for one minute unless you press cook time.

The defrost function is very confusing, it is unclear how to use and what information the microwave needs when using the defrost function, it comes up with a snowflake type of symbol then after you select a time.

My most common uses of a microwave are to heat up food that has already been cooked and on occasion to thaw out meat. The microwave does make these things easier because when heating something up you can use the 30 sec increment button and check on it instead of having to press multiple buttons to accomplish the same task. 

The common series of actions are to open the door, select a time using only the numbers or the quick thirty second button, shut the door and then press start and open the door again to take the food back out.

The microwave shows the user how it works but having all of the specific food categories at the top then after having all of the numbers. It also has pictures on the start and cancel buttons, these are the only pictures on the microwave so they stand out especially and if youâ€™re just trying to start it quickly even from using it the first time you will be able to tell with ease, not having to read the whole control panel. 

The microwave provides feedback to the user by beeping anytime you press a button and when the timer is done beeping three times consecutively or when you open the door. 


Some current mistakes you can make with this design are, not knowing how to open the door, assuming that the time will immeadtely be one minute if pressing the 1 button. 



Here is my final design:
